                    <p><em>"The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed."</em><br/>
											<span style="margin-left:20px"> - William Gibson</span></p><p>Decision, decisions. Users are
											screaming to pay money for your service, but your current infrastructure is going to pop like
										 	a balloon if you let any more sign up. Or your cumbersome deployment process has slowed enterprise 
											sales to a crawl as your small support team runs themselves ragged. Is your competition widening the
										 	feature gap due to your lengthy test and release cycle? How to process all that customer data into 
											useful trends? Your decisions today will mean soaring profit or smoldering ruin. How will you solve 
											these problems? Traditional answers to these questions lead many organizations down roads from which 
											they never return. But in the future? Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads... &nbsp;</p>
											<p>You may have tried incremental approaches that were so incremental that nothing changed. You may 
											have attempted full system overhauls, only to have the budget and schedule blow up in your face 
											while the problems remained - or got worse. Or you may not even know where to start.</p>
											<p>Usually the problem isn’t a lack of skill. It’s not a lack of commitment. Or an aversion to hard work. 
											No, what’s holding you back is a failure of <em>imagination</em>. Most people self-censor (whether 
											they are aware of it or not), limiting themselves to what they think is possible. We tend to stick to 
											what we know how to do or have seen others do. Because we cannot see a <em>path</em> to the future we 
											would like to see, we <em>fail to see that future at all</em>. &nbsp;Ironically, when we come across 
											someone who did manage to transcend these mental limits, we say that they “saw what others could not see”. 
											Actually these visionaries see <em>less</em> than others - they don’t &nbsp;see the walls that block others' 
											view of a better world. They don’t impose restrictions on the future. The difference is that <em>they 
											believe in magic.</em></p><p>So forget what you and the people around you already know <em>how</em> to do. 
											Forget what you have <em>time</em> to do. Forget what you have the <em>budget</em> to do. Forget what you 
											think others will <em>let</em> you do. Instead, ask yourself:</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>If I could 
											wave a magic wand and make the solution appear, what would it look like?</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Ignore how you 
											are going to get there and just think about what things will look like once you arrive. You need to
											<em>believe</em>.</p><p>Working backwards from a “magical” solution will result in a better real world 
											solution than you can get to by crawling forward on your belly around obstacles you find along the
											road.</p><p><em>"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."</em><br/>
											<span style="margin-left:20px"> — Arthur C. Clarke</span></p><p>With the future of your business at stake, 
											you need a new approach for solving your tough problems. &nbsp;At Cognitect, we help teams break through
											preconceptions that hold them back. To envision systems unrestrained by the limits of traditional development 
											tools, to design the <strong>right</strong> solution to grow your business. The results sometimes seem magical 
											- our modern tech stack of <a href="http://cognitect.com/clojure">Clojure</a> and <a href="http://cognitect.com/datomic">Datomic</a> enables development of <a href="http://cognitect.com/clojure#successstories">
											flexible cloud-based systems</a> at significantly less cost than traditional approaches. Technologies 
											now exist that enable small teams to build enterprise-grade solutions on schedules and budgets that not long ago
											really <em>would</em> have required a pointy hat and cloak.</p><p>As noted by former Chief Architect of Netflix’s
										 	Cloud Services <a href="https://www.battery.com/our-team/member/adrian-cockcroft/">Adrian Cockcroft</a>, Clojure
										 	allows developers to produce "ridiculously sophisticated things in a very short time.” And immutable data - 
											a hallmark of the Datomic database - grants complete auditability of values and transactions from any previous 
											time, plus the ability to model potential scenarios without committing changes. Relive the past? Peer into 
											the future? Datomic may not actually let you travel through time, but the results are just about
											indistinguishable.</p><p>You can attempt to solve your problem with the traditional approach. But are you 
											planning the <strong>right</strong> solution? Or just what you can put together with the tools and ideas inside 
											the barriers that have accreted across your organizational field of vision? Or will you forget 
											what <em>is</em> and imagine what <em>could be</em>, without preconceived limitations and constraints? 
											Don’t settle for a faster horse - demand a rocket ship. This may be the path less traveled, but it will 
											make all the difference.</p>
