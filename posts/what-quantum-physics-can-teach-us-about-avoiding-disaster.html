                    <p>
                        Back in 2008, just months before the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed work on the world’s
                        largest and most powerful particle accelerator, two men, Walter Wagner and Luis Sancho, 
                        <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/science/29collider.html">filed a lawsuit</a> to stop it. Their
                        claim? That if CERN's Large Hadron Collider (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider">LHC</a>)
                        succeeded in its goal of smashing together tiny particles at extremely high speeds, it would create a black hole 
                        and cause the total annihilation of the Earth. Their implication was clear: The LHC would be bad for business.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The suit was filed in Hawaii, whose jurisdiction over intergovernmental European organizations is, well, questionable.
                        Perhaps intrigued by the possibility of free pineapples, an independent Safety Assessment Group was formed to look into 
                        the matter. Their <a href="http://lsag.web.cern.ch/lsag/LSAG-Report.pdf">report</a> cited no basis for concern, stating 
                        "Nature has already conducted the equivalent of about a hundred thousand LHC experimental programs on Earth already – and 
                        the planet still exists.” The project moved forward. The LHC was fired up and... it worked. Zoom, zoom, bang, bang, ooh, 
                        ooh. The result of this success was, to the good fortune of entrepreneurs and other living things, not a planet-killing 
                        vacuum but a first glimpse of the elusive <a href="http://home.cern/topics/higgs-boson">Higgs boson</a>.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        History may look upon Walter Wagner and Luis Sancho as a bit alarmist. Their 
                        <a href="https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/hawaii/hidce/1:2008cv00136/78717/91">case</a> 
                        was dismissed and the LHC has operated for several annihilation-free years. But in their panic, there is perhaps also 
                        wisdom: Lean methodology emphasizes the importance of agility and adapting after failure, of running postmortems, of 
                        asking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 Whys</a>. What Wagner and Sancho teach us is to prepare not 
                        just for when we are wrong, but also when we are right. They remind us fatal consequences can ensue if we do not also 
                        prepare for what happens when we <em>succeed</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Growing companies are increasingly adept at looking out for and embracing failure. Fail fast, fail often. During 
                        development, CERN suffered frequent setbacks and failures. At one point, the LHC nearly melted down when a bird dropped a 
                        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/nov/06/cern-big-bang-goes-phut">baguette</a> into a cooling unit. The 
                        team worked methodically through each obstacle and mistake, learning and adapting until they succeeded at bringing the new 
                        system online. But Wagner and Sancho never asked what would happen if the LHC didn’t work. They weren’t worried about cost 
                        overruns, schedule slippage or faulty electrical connections. What kept Wagner and Sancho up at night was fear that 
                        humanity was not prepared for the consequences of CERN’s <em>success</em>. Think about your upcoming marketing campaign, the 
                        deployment of your new infrastructure, or release of an exciting new feature. You have iterated and learned and are poised 
                        to reap your rewards. Are you really prepared for what happens next?
                    </p>
					                        
                    <p>
                        Assume it all succeeds brilliantly. Can you support a massive influx of new customers? Or will the huge volume destroy 
                        your great service and fast fulfillment and ruin your reputation? The new infrastructure may be secure and reliable, but 
                        how will it affect your day-to-day business workflow? Almost certainly it will change how your people and teams work 
                        together. Newly empowered teams can overwhelm departments that seemed solid in the past. Bottlenecks often shift rather 
                        than disappear and the old annoyance becomes a lethal blockage. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Wagner and Sancho teach us to ask these questions. Your organization may not be building a giant atom smasher, but worlds 
                        will most certainly collide. You’ve focused hard on things that could go wrong. You’ve learned to face, accept, and learn 
                        from failure. Against improbable odds your team has broken through every barrier. Learn from CERN - before flipping that 
                        switch, create your own Safety Assessment Group and focus on what happens next if everything goes <em>as planned</em>. 
                        You’re almost there. Stop. Are you really ready? The unexpected outcome might not be a planet-swallowing black hole, but 
                        it could be just as fatal to your business. 
                    </p>
