                        Hear me now, for I have seen things. A world of ash and soot. Bodies and brains toiling day after day, 
                        pushing boulders up steep mountainsides. When these burdens are overcome, when the peak is crested and 
                        victory achieved there is neither reward nor respite. Burning disappointment is the only prize, a hot 
                        frustration as the mighty stones are sent careening once again to the depths below in endless repetition. 
                        This, my friends is the future of agile development. For the past several years I have consulted with 
                        over 20 companies - from tiny startups to giant global enterprises. I have seen the inner workings, 
                        corporate cultures, and development practices across a wide range of industries. The trends are disturbing.
                         I have seen the future and it is nasty and brutish. We can and must alter course. Resistance is NOT futile.
                    </p>

                    <p>Why agile?</p>

                    <p>
                        In the beginning, before agile, was the waterfall. We were doing multi-year projects, implementing reams of 
                        printed specifications, missing ship dates and blowing budgets. Most damning of all, we created products that 
                        didn’t meet the customer's needs. As big deadlines loomed, teams fell into death marches, with horrible periods 
                        of late nights and heated arguments, broken builds and streams of bugs without end. A game of lose-lose, the 
                        epitome of action not equalling progress.
                    </p> 

                    <p>
                        Then a group of survivors hatched a plan of escape. Let’s break the cycle and put real customer satisfaction first. 
                        Let’s welcome changing requirements. Let’s deliver early and often. Let’s  communicate across teams and reflect 
                        upon ways to improve. Above all, let’s promote sustainable development - 
                        a <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">manifesto</a> for practices that would enable 
                        sponsors, developers, and users to maintain a constant pace. Indefinitely. It made so much sense. And a few teams 
                        have indeed managed to succeed and thrive. Yet here we are, many of us, every 2 weeks. Surrounded by pizza boxes 
                        and despair. The points. The pressure. The last minute check-ins, the skimping on QA. The tortured definitions 
                        of “complete.” The pronouncements of SUCCESS (yay!) or FAILURE (boo!) every fortnight. OMG it’s happening again. 
                        And again. And again! Every 2 weeks. WTF?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Many organizations took their few, real deadlines - a Beta version, big conference demo, or the major public 
                        release - and rolled the incumbent pressure and "all hands on deck" mentality into a twice monthly cannonball run. 
                        Remember those large waterfall endeavors? Even if the product was too little or too late, there was at least a time 
                        to recharge at the end. To rest and to dream, a period of calm to plan a new route forward. But in many “agile” 
                        organizations, there is no rest and no peace. Just another boulder to push up another hill. Say what you will 
                        about the horrors of a waterfall death march, these teams at least got to sleep once they were dead. In stark 
                        contrast, many agile teams are rousted from their dirt naps before pushing a single daisy. The “big deadline” 
                        is now every sprint’s end. This is endless war. This is not about “keeping commitments.” This is not what agile 
                        was meant to be. This is not even madness. 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZeYVIWz99I&feature=youtu.be&t=4s" target="_blank">This. Is. Sparta.</a> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many so-called “agile” organizations have mistaken the process for the product. The daily “how confident are you 
                        this card will be done today?” The inevitable “pretty confident unless things don’t go as planned.” This is a 
                        bogus dance. This is project management 
                        <a href="http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/12/9/story-points-must-die-a-spacetime-adventure?rq=theater">theater</a>. 
                        Even the notion of “delivering working software frequently” to maintain a healthy feedback channel is being corrupted. 
                        Rather than a brief reflection on progress toward the finish line, most end-of-sprint reviews fixate on “how well 
                        did we do compared to our guesses 2 weeks ago?” 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The truth is that we are running a marathon here, people. Treating it like a series of independent races, a chain of 
                        back-to-back “sprints” is not the way to win a marathon, nor is it the way to build software. To be truly agile we iterate, 
                        we take stock of progress toward the finish line and we adjust as we go. No particular mile is more important (or detached) 
                        from any other. Don’t start, stop, start, stop, start, stop. Focus on the end goal and run, dammit, RUN.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Enough with the burndown charts. Enough with the sprint-end whiplash. Establish clear priorities and guidelines - 
                        set a vision of what success looks like. Slow occasionally to take stock and adjust as needed, but keep moving 
                        forward at a steady pace.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Let’s stop rolling boulders up and down meaningless hills, and let’s start moving mountains.  
                    </p>
